###PROJECTS
*FPGA Powered Intervehicle Rover| TIET|Jan 2024 Technologies: Embedded systems, IOT, Master-Slave Architecture
 Master-Slave Architecture: FPGA (Basys 3) master rover communicates with ESP32 slave rovers via low-power Wi-Fi.  Peer-to-Peer Coordination: ESP32-to-ESP32 communication between slave rovers and Data Throughput (ESP32 to ESP32) is 2 Mbps using ESP-NOW protocol.  Hybrid Network Design: Combines centralized (FPGA to ESP32) and decentralized (ESP32 to ESP32) communication and Signal
degradation of less than 10% in the presence of 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi interference.
*Hydroponics EC Control system| TIET|April 2024 Technologies: IOT, Communication, Real-time Monitoring
 Data Throughput: Achieved real-time monitoring with a 1-second update interval for EC, pH, water level, and temperature data.  Accuracy: Maintained sensor accuracy within ±0.1 unitsfor pH and EC, ensuring optimal plant growth. 
*Network Configuration Project using GNS3| TIET|Nov 2023 Technologies: GNS3,Network Protocols,IP Addressing and Subnetting
 Configured a complex network topology using GNS3 wit classless IP addressing to ensure minimal IP wastage.  Successfully established connectivity between Routers using PING command.
